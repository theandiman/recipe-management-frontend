# Add staging and production environments by copying the dev structure
# and updating the project_id and environment labels

# Staging example:
# terraform/environments/staging/
#   main.tf       - Update project_id to "recipe-mgmt-staging"
#   variables.tf  - Update default project_id
#   outputs.tf    - Same as dev

# Production example:
# terraform/environments/prod/
#   main.tf       - Update project_id to "recipe-mgmt-prod"
#   variables.tf  - Update default project_id
#   outputs.tf    - Same as dev
